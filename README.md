### Refactored Code Pros and Cons

- Refactoring code is generally good practice because it improves readability, performance, and understanding. Refactoring code ensures the code is maintained and improved over time, which is helpful for both present and future developers.

- However, refactoring code runs the risk of encountering bugs and other issues. It is important that when code is refactored, present and future developers are able to understand how it works.
